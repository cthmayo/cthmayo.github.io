# Data Science Portfolio by cthmayo

A compilation of notebooks for a number of data science and AI-related side projects I worked on during 2020-2021.

## Medical Projects

### [RANZCR CLiP - Catheter and Line Position Challenge](https://github.com/cthmayo/line-placement/blob/main/Line_Position.ipynb)

This was my entry into the [RANZCR CLiP - Catheter and Line Position Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ranzcr-clip-catheter-line-classification), which involved the detection of the presence of number of different types of lines and catheters on chest X-rays. I evaluated a series of different machine learning methods, eventually choosing an EfficientNetB0 CNN. My Kaggle entry is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/cthmayo/efficientnetb0-inference).

### [COVID-19 CT Diagnosis](https://github.com/cthmayo/covid-diagnosis/blob/main/COVID_Diagnosis_Complete.ipynb)

This project was an attempt at diagnosing patients with COVID-19 based on single 2D CT slices, sourced from [here](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT). In this project I compared and evaluated several machine learning methods, including random forests, logistic regression, and two different convolutional neural network architectures.

### [Alcoholic EEG Analysis](https://github.com/cthmayo/eeg-preprocessing/blob/main/EEG_Preprocessing.ipynb)

This project involved preprocessing of electroencephalogram signals sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nnair25/Alcoholics).

## Fun Projects

### [Predicting Wrestle Kingdom 15](https://github.com/cthmayo/match-predictor/blob/main/Predicting-Wrestle-Kingdom-15.ipynb)

A fun project where I used machine learning to predict the results of professional wrestling matches.
