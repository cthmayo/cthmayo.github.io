# Data Science Portfolio by cthmayo

A compilation of notebooks for a number of data science and AI-related side projects I worked on during 2020-2021.

## Medical Projects

### [COVID-19 CT Diagnosis](https://github.com/cthmayo/covid-diagnosis/blob/main/COVID_Diagnosis_Complete.ipynb)

This project was an attempt at diagnosing patients with COVID-19 based on single 2D CT slices, sourced from [here](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT). In this project I compared and evaluated several machine learning methods, including random forests, logistic regression, and two different convolutional neural network architectures.

### Alcoholic EEG Analysis

This project involved signal processing of electroencephalogram signals sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nnair25/Alcoholics): the aim of this project was to investigate differences in brain connectivity between heavy consumers of alcohol and a control group.

## Fun Projects

### [Predicting Wrestle Kingdom 15](https://github.com/cthmayo/match-predictor/blob/main/Predicting-Wrestle-Kingdom-15.ipynb)

A fun project where I used machine learning to predict the results of professional wrestling matches.
